<p>This <b>HydroSurvSizePred</b> is an interactive query tool to explore patterns of spring/summer-run Chinook Salmon passing Lower Granite Dam and Bonneville Dam as smolts and compare the following:

<div style='text-align: center; margin: auto;'>
<ul style='display: inline-block; text-align: left;'>
<li><b>Smolt length:</b> The distribution of smolt lengths can be explored across years, months, and half-months throughout the outmigration season. These data were queried from PTAGIS.</li>
<li><b>Predation risk:</b> The percentages of smolts below size thresholds susceptible to fish predation can be viewed. The proportions were calculated following Muir et al. (2006) and the size distributions of N. Pikeminnow (Winther et al. 2021) and Pacific Hake (Taylor et al. 205) observed each year.</li>
<li><b>Survival:</b> Estimates of survival from LWG-BON (downstream survival), BON-BOA (estuary & ocean survival), and LWG-BOA were determined from PIT tagged fish data from PTAGIS. Survival of transported fish from LGR-BON is assumed to be 1.</li>
<li><b>Length, predation risk, survival:</b> A comparison between length distributions, predation risk, and LWG-BOA survival is available for viewing across years.
