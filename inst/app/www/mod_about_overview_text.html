<p>Smolts migrating downstream the Snake and Columbia rivers towards the Pacific Ocean encounter fish predators, such as Northern Pikeminnow (N. Pikeminnow). As the smolts migrate through the early ocean environment, they encounter additional fish predators, such as Pacific Hake (Muir et al. 2006). Size-selective predation can be particularly important for small salmon smolts. Their sizes differ across years and through the season, depending on conditions experienced that affect their growth.</p>

<p>Smolts may also differ in size depending on the type of passage: in-river or transported passage through the hydrosystem (Lower Granite Dam [LWG] to Bonneville Dam [BON]) (Figure 1). Transported smolts may be smaller than in-river smolts because of loss of growth opportunity during their short passage through the hydrosystem (transported: 2 days; in-river: ~2-4 weeks). Smaller smolts will be at greater risk of predation than larger smolts, and predation risk will also depend on the size distribution of the predators. The proportion of fish below a size threshold can be an indicator of survival (Muir et al. 2006).</p>

<p>Survival can be estimated through the hydrosystem (LGR-BON), post-hydrosystem (juveniles at BON to adults at BOA), and these reaches altogether (LGR-BOA) from fish tagged with passive integrated transponder tags and through mark-recapture modeling (Cormack 1964, Jolly 1965, Seber 1965, Gosselin et al. 2021).</p>
<p>This application aims to allow users to view size distribution of smolt and how that may impact predation risk through downstream migration. A user can then compare size distribution and predation risk, to predicted survival based on reach and passage type. To view each factor, see the subpages within the <b>SizePred Survival App</b>, or select the <em>Size, Predation, and Survival</em> subpage to compare all three for specific years of interest.</p>
