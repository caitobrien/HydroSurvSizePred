# HydroSurvSizePred

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **HydroSurvSizePred** is to explore spring/summer Chinook salmon, *Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*,  smolt length distributions, predator risk from Northern Pikeminnow and Pacific Hake, and survival across years and seasons during downstream migration through the Federal Columbia River Power System Hydrosystem (FCRPS)

Please note that this Shiny App is dependent on data availability and serves as an exploratory tool.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **HydroSurvSizePred** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# Install the developmental version of the HydroSurvSizePred package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("caitobrien/HydroSurvSizePred")

# Load the package
library(HydroSurvSizePred)

# Run the app
run_app()
```
*Since project is currently in development, please rerun `install_github("caitobrien/HydroSurvSizePred")` to see latest commits. If no commits since last import, a warning will appear: "Skipping install of 'HydroSurvSizePred' from a github remote, the SHA1 (fdd71350) has not changed since last install. Use `force = TRUE` to force installation"


If you are interested in the files that support the development version, please see: (https://github.com/caitobrien/HydroSurvSizePred)[https://github.com/caitobrien/HydroSurvSizePred] for files necessary to run. The app structure follows a Golem framework described in (Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps)[https://engineering-shiny.org/setting-up-for-success.html] by Colin Fay, SÃ©bastien Rochette, Vincent Guyader and Cervan Girard.

```{r update_readme, include=FALSE}
#You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
#devtools::build_readme()
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(HydroSurvSizePred)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
