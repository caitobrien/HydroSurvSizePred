The goal of **HydroSurvSizePred** is to explore spring/summer Chinook salmon, *Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*,  smolt length distributions, predator risk from Northern Pikeminnow and Pacific Hake, and survival across years and seasons during downstream migration through the Federal Columbia River Power System Hydrosystem (FCRPS), Pacific Northwest, USA. 

*Please note that this Shiny App is currently under development and dependent on data availability. This app serves as an exploratory tool.*

## Installation

You can install the development version of **HydroSurvSizePred** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# Install the developmental version of the HydroSurvSizePred package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("caitobrien/HydroSurvSizePred")

# Load the package
library(HydroSurvSizePred)

# Run the app
run_app()
```
**HydroSurvSizePred** is currently in development and changes are continuously being made. If you have already imported to R studio, please rerun `install_github("caitobrien/HydroSurvSizePred")` to see latest changes in the developmental version. If no changes have been made since last import, a warning will appear: `Skipping install of 'HydroSurvSizePred' from a github remote, the SHA1 (fdd71350) has not changed since last install. Use 'force = TRUE' to force installation` and you have the latest developmental version imported.



If you are interested in the files that support the development version, please see: [https://github.com/caitobrien/HydroSurvSizePred](https://github.com/caitobrien/HydroSurvSizePred) for files necessary to run. 

The app structure follows a Golem framework described in [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org/setting-up-for-success.html) by Colin Fay, SÃ©bastien Rochette, Vincent Guyader and Cervan Girard.
